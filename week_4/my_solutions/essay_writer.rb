#Pseudocode

# Create a function called essay_writer that takes in arguments - title,topic,date,thesis_statement,city,number
# Declare variable template1
# if pronoun = female, substitue he(exact pattern) with she and his with her
# Substitute title in template with value of title variable in template1
# Substitute topic in template with value of topic variable in template1
# Substiture date in template with value of date variable in template1
# Substitute thesis_statement with value of thesis_statement in template1
#Substitute city with value of city variable in template1
#Substitute number with value of Number variable in template1
# Split the template1 variable with '.'
# capitalize first word of every new sentence
# Print the Output

# Reflection
# What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
# This assignment was challenging for me. Since there was no rspec or driver code , and we basically had to come up with our own solution, it was tough.
# I used gsub! a lot to do my substitutions . Not sure if that was expected. Also I am not able to get my driver test code to pass when I compare strings
# What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
# I had to research on gsub! and using regular expressions

# What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
# Basically how complex the code should be and what was expected. I wasnt sure and came up with the best possible solution I could think of.
# Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
# Yes gsub and liitle bit of Regular Expressions

# How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?
#Fairly confident
# Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
# Well seeing the output was great,
# Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
# Driver test code and just thinking of how I should code this and whats the expected output.
