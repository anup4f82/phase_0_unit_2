# U2.W5: Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge by myself

# Run the code. Look at the output. Look at the input (it's in the other file). Explain what the program is doing.
# The code is using the State_data Hash as input and predicting the Number of deaths and time taken to lose the people. To do that we have to create a new object per state
# and pass the state_of_origin#,population_density,population,region and regional_spread as arguments and then use the predicted_deaths and speed_of_spread methods
# to outut the result.
# Write a comment explaining the require_relative statement - You should be somewhat familiar with this by now.
# require_relative Statement means the file state_data is in the same directory as the original_code.rb file. When we run the code it will search for the file 
#state_data in this directory.
# Take a look at the state_data file. What is going on with this hash? What does it have in it? (HINT: There are two different syntax used for hashes here. What's the difference?)
# The State_data hash is a Nested hash, with the State as the inner hash and then the State data as the innermost hash. There are two ways to create Key value
#pairs in a Hash. One is using the => and the other is using colons.
# Comment each method and define it's responsibility.
# New Feature: create a report for all 50 states, not just the 4 listed below. Is there a DRY way of doing this?
# Refactor the virus_effects method. (HINT: what is the scope of instance variables?)
# Instance variables are available across all the methods of the Class for which the object is created. Once we create an object for a Class, the Instance variables
# are valid for the state of that object.
# What is the purpose of "private". What happens if you move it elsewhere in the class?
# private - Any methods that are after the keyword private are private methods. They cant be called with a explicit receiver. e.gL you cant use alabama.predicted_deaths directly
#
# Refactor the private methods predicted_deaths and speed_of_spread. How can you make them more DRY?
#
# BONUS: Access the population by calling it on the instance.
