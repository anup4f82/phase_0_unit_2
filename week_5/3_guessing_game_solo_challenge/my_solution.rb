# U2.W5: Build a simple guessing game SOLO CHALLENGE


<<<<<<< HEAD
# I worked on this challenge by myself
# Define a Class called GuessingGame
# Define a initializer method for the Class Guessingame which takes one argument 'answer' .Create and Set the instancevariable @answer to answer
# Define a method called guess which takes argument as guess,Create and set instance variable @guess to guess
# if @guess < @answer return low, 
#     elseif @guess > @answer return high 
#             else return correct
#Define a method called solved? which takes returns false if @answer not equal to @guess, else returns true.

# How to use instance variables,create objects
# What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
# None
# Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
# Creating objects,instance variables.
# How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?
# Very confident
